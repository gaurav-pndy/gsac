      <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed ">
        GSAC is an International Conclave on sustainable aviation committed to
        addressing the Pathway to Net Zero Aviation thereby serving as a
        platform for collaboration, knowledge exchange, and the development of
        strategies aimed at achieving a greener, more efficient, and sustainable
        future for global aviation.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        The event highlights emerging trends, innovative practices, and the
        critical role of international cooperation in achieving long-term
        environmental goals for the aviation industry. Any growth that is not
        sustainable is a threat to its very existence.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        GSAC seeks solutions to improve the environmental and societal impacts
        of air transportation. It aims to reduce aviation’s contribution to
        climate change through new practices and radical innovation. It can
        cover a wide range of topics including highly efficient aircraft
        designs, novel propulsion systems, green aircraft technologies, and
        energy-optimized flight operations to reduce aircraft energy
        consumption, noise, and emissions.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
        This conclave aims to serve as a dynamic platform for high-level
        discourse, bringing together global thought leaders, industry
        executives, regulators, policymakers, military veterans, investors,
        sustainability experts, and diplomats to explore sustainable solutions
        for the aviation sector.

        Strategic Context
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Over the past decades, the aviation industry has made significant
        progress in fuel and CO2 efficiency, halving the amount of fuel used per
        flight compared to 1990. In other words, a flight today would generate
        just 50% CO2 compared to the same flight back then. This has been
        achieved through technological advancement and improvements in
        operations and infrastructure. However, overall emissions have risen as
        the volume of air traffic has increased.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Most growth has occurred in emerging economies, as they begin to reap
        the benefits of air travel. As aviation demand grows, so does the
        urgency to reconcile expansion with environmental sustainability.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        The aviation industry stands at a critical juncture, compelled to
        decarbonize in line with international climate commitments such as the
        Paris Agreement and ICAO’s long-term global aspirational goals.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), green infrastructure, advanced
        technologies, digital and data-driven efficiencies, and
        climate-resilient financing models are major pillars in the
        transformation of the industry.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed">
        Yet, transitioning to sustainable aviation is fraught with challenges
        including limited production capacity and high SAF costs, regulatory
        uncertainty and policy fragmentation, substantial capital requirements,
        and limited climate finance access—especially in developing countries
        like India.
      </p>
      <p>
        India and other developing countries face a unique double challenge:
        supporting aviation as a lever of economic growth while committing to
        low-carbon pathways. This creates a critical need for collaborative
        approaches involving governments, industry players, multilateral
        institutions, investors, and innovators to unlock a just and inclusive
        green aviation transition.
